    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Anyone who knows me, knows I have a certain obsession with the movie office space. I have a few red Swingline staplers, Initech coffee mugs, and various T-Shirts.</p>

<p>I decided that I was in need of a &ldquo;Jump to Conclusions&rdquo; app for my phone (for those difficult decisions). If you don&rsquo;t know what this is, it&rsquo;s based on the Jump to Conclusion mat described by Tom Smykowski as a &ldquo;Mat that you put on the floor, that has different "conclusions&rdquo; written on it that you can &ldquo;jump&rdquo; to".</p>

<p>While some claimed it was a horrible idea, Tom went ahead with it and built a prototype.

<p>I followed his design to build my Android application.

<p>Similar to the mat, you open the app, hold the phone in your hand, and jump to conclusions. It will give you a random conclusion every time.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve published it in the play store: <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.initech.mats">https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.initech.mats</a></p>

<p>I&rsquo;m quite happy with the results.</p>
